# GAME PLAN

## Game Components

- Pieces
- Tiles
- The Board
- Players (White and Black)
- Moves
- Alliances (color)
  
The GUI will be just the visualization of the game of these interacting components

## Object Requirements

**Pieces**
      - Position
      - Alliance/Color
      - A type (abstract Piece class)

**Tiles**
    - 

**Pieces**

**Tiles**

**The Board**

**Players (White and Black)**

**Moves**

**Aliances**
    This will just be an enum so not much functionality for this
