# Chess Personal Project

**Contribtors:** Jonah Osband

Welcome to my Chess Personal Project. For this project, I implementd chess, a game that I enjoy (although, I am not very good). I demonstrated my knowledge of OOP principle and utilized Java Swing for the graphics, something I was originally quite unfarmiliar with. This project is currently a work in progress so feel free to check in. This project is still in the early stages of development. If you want to coment on this or fork the repository, feel free to do such and reach out!
