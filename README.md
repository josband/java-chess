# Java Chess **Under Development**

**Contribtors:** Jonah Osband

## Description
Welcome to my Chess Personal Project. For this project, I am implementing chess, a game that I enjoy (although, I am not very good). I am doing this project as a fun way to demonstrate my knowledge of object-oriented programming principles and overall program design. This is also the first project in which I am making a GUI (I am using Java Swing for this game). 

This project is currently a work in progress so feel free to check in and keep track of the changes I make! I only began this project recently and I am still in the planning phase and structuring my classes. If you want to comment on this or fork the repository, feel free to do such and reach out! However, I will not accept pull requests as this is to demonstrate my knowledge.
